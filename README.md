# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Credit card fraud is a significant concern for both consumers and financial institutions. One way to combat fraud is to use machine learning algorithms to detect suspicious transactions. Scikit-Learn is a popular open-source machine learning library in Python, and Snap ML is a high-performance machine learning library from IBM designed for large-scale datasets.

Using Scikit-Learn and Snap ML, it is possible to build accurate and efficient credit card fraud detection models. The process typically involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. Preprocessing steps may include data cleaning, transformation, and normalization. Feature engineering is the process of selecting and creating features that can improve the performance of the model. Model training involves selecting a suitable algorithm and optimizing its parameters using a training dataset. Evaluation is carried out using a test dataset to measure the model's performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Scikit-Learn offers a wide range of machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and logistic regression, among others. Snap ML, on the other hand, is designed to handle large-scale datasets using parallel and distributed computing techniques, making it ideal for big data applications.

Overall, using Scikit-Learn and Snap ML, credit card fraud detection models can be built with high accuracy, scalability, and efficiency. By detecting fraudulent transactions early, financial institutions can reduce losses and improve customer satisfaction.
